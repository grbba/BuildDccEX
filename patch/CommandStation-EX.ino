//
// If you used the automatic installer program, config.h will have been created automatically.
// 
// To obtain a starting copy of config.h please copy the file config.example.h which is 
// shipped with the code and may be updated as new features are added. 
// 
// If config.h is not found, config.example.h will be used with all defaults.
